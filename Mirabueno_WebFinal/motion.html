        Submitted on 16 April 2021 —  Animate Final Project — I added effects to the logo created for my Illustrator final (completed on 18 March 2021). The animation was accompanied by the intro to Frank Sinatra's, "Come Fly With Me."  About the design — Inspired by vintage airline logos, the background features an image of an airplane in the sky because looking up and seeing a plane always brings me good feelings.  My dad worked for an airline and growing up, he would take my siblings and I to watch the planes touch down at SFO.  We also had miniature airplane models lying around the house.  Looking back now, I would say my appreciation for graphic design began when I was a kid with airline logos and airplanes in general.
