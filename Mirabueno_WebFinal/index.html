        <p> 
        I am a San Francisco native with a severe case of wanderlust. This site serves as my final project for City College of San Francisco's VMD-105 and a collection of my favorite assignments completed in Spring 2021, a semester during the outbreak of COVID-19. Though I was restricted to staying at home, the projects and skills I learned in this course make up for not being able to leave the country within the past year. Hope my works take you out of this world. Thanks for visiting.
